One way to measure access to care is timeliness.  Long delays to see a healthcare provider can speak to availability issues, either a lack of resources or inefficiencies that result in a less than optimal conversion of referrals into appointments. Long delays can also speak to accomodation issues or accessibility issues if patients have difficulty attending their scheduled appointments.
This project is an example of a report that I created to look at the process times for referred patients at specialty clinics.

### Data sources 
For the purposes of demonstration this example report loads data from three Comma Separated Values files.  The data in these files has been fabricated as an example.  It does not represent any real healthcare organization.   

Referrals.csv
: A file containing one row for each referral and columns with the dates when each referral reached a process milestone.  Other columns are also included that are helpful for monthly monitoring. 

DirectSecureMessages.csv
: A file containing one row for each Direct Secure Message about a patient that was sent to a referral inbox. These are used to measure how often messages are used in place of referrals. 

StandardCalendar.csv
: Contains the data for the standard date dimension table used across reports.
