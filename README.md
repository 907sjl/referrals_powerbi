## Specialty Clinic Referral-To-Appointment Rates

**Project description:** One way to measure access to care is timeliness.  Long delays to see a healthcare provider can speak to availability issues, either a lack of resources or inefficiencies that result in a less than optimal conversion of referrals into appointments. Long delays can also speak to accomodation issues or accessibility issues if patients have difficulty attending their scheduled appointments.
This project is an example of a report that I created to look at the process times for referred patients at specialty clinics. 

The numerical values in these reports are fabricated and do not represent any real healthcare organization.
